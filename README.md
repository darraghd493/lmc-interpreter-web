# lmc-interpreter-web

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), serving as a minimal site for [lmc-interpreter](https://github.com/darraghd493/lmc-interpreter).

**Note:** the code is of very poor quality.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
